Project webpage: http://www.eecs.umich.edu/vision/3DGP/

This package is an implementation of the indoor scene understanding method described in 
(W. Choi, Y. -W. Chao, C. Pantofaru and S. Savarese "Understanding Indoor Scenes using 3D Geometric Phrases", CVPR 2013). 

For questions concerning the code please contact Wongun Choi at <wgchoi AT umich DOT edu>.

The system is implemented in Matlab. 

Basic Usage
===========

Currently, only testing part of the method is released. Training algorithm will be made available soon as well. 

To test:
--------

The package include a script "demo_test.m" that replicates the results reported in our CVPR paper. The code does, 
1. downloading dataset
2. preprocessing images - object detection (Felzenszwalb et al, PAMI 2010), scene classification (Lazebnik et al, CVPR 2006) and indoor layout estimation (Hedau et al, ICCV 2009)
3. running 3DGP model
4. evaluation (detection, scene classification, layout estimation)
5. visualization of examplar results
