% SHOWOBJECTS M-file for showObjects.fig
%      SHOWOBJECTS, by itself, creates a new SHOWOBJECTS or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SHOWOBJECTS returns the handle to a new SHOWOBJECTS or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SHOWOBJECTS('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SHOWOBJECTS.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SHOWOBJECTS('Property','Value',...) creates a new SHOWOBJECTS or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before showObjects_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to showObjects_OpeningFcn via varargin.
